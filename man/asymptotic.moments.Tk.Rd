\usage{
asymptotic.moments.Tk(m, n, k, correlation_remainder)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{: calibration sample size}

\item{n}{: test sample size}

\item{k}{: order of the LMPI test statistic}

\item{correlation_remainder}{: correlation between the \eqn{U}-statistic \eqn{T_k} and the remainder}
}
\value{
It returns the mean and the variance of the asymptotic distribution of \eqn{T_k}.
For \eqn{k=1,2,3} the exact mean is given, i.e., the finite-sample mean,
and the provided estimate of the variance is more accurate than the first order asymptotic approximation.
