\usage{
d_ttest(S_Y, S_X, alpha = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{S_Y}{: score vector of test observations}

\item{S_X}{: score vector of calibration observations}

\item{alpha}{: significance level of the local test. Default value is set equal to 0.1.}
}
\value{
An integer which is the \eqn{(1 âˆ’ \alpha)}-confidence lower bound for the
number of true discoveries using step-down Dunnett test procedure, which is
closed testing procedure using Dunnett t-test local test.
The selection set is trivial, i.e., we are interested in testing all the observations in the test set by default.
}
\description{
It returns a confidence lower bound for the number of true discoveries provided
by closed testing procedure using Dunnett t-test as local test.
